## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Of Oppong’s six habits of super learners, I currently incorporate a few of these as part of my daily activities. I do read a lot (or at least I listen to audiobooks often - right now I’m “reading” The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg). I view learning as a process; there is always more to learn and more to explore. It’s infinite and it’s exciting too. If I come across an interesting concept, I gladly share it with my friends and bring it up in the conversation naturally. I’m not directly teaching them, but I am sharing my newfound knowledge. I am a very healthy eater. After spending years and years living in a tour bus, eating meals whenever we can get them (mostly fast food and gas station food), I came home and started cooking a whole-foods, vegetarian diet.

Reading these habits make me want to set goals for myself and hold myself accountable for them. They don’t have to be super life changing, but a small success here and there can lead to some positive changes down the road. The last habit he lists covers the importance of taking breaks. This is something I definitely need to work on to improve. Once I get in the zone, it is hard for me to break away and I have a tendency to over-do it.

If I were to add anything to the list, I would add some sort of way to stretch your mind in a creative aspect. Imagination and dreaming up new concepts is such a powerful tool, but that too is a muscle that needs to be exercised.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

number - these are positive, negative, whole, or partial numbers that live outside of quotes

string - these are a combination of characters that include letters, numbers, as well as '$' and '_' that all live inside quotes

boolean - these either have one of two outcomes, true or false


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log('"Hello World"');


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
You use 2 // for javascript to ignore whatever is after that on that line. The purpose of these code comments is to offer an
explanation of what is happening in the code; this is for future developers looking at the code or even yourself


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is label that holds data or information.
It's like a lunchbox (variable) holding the food inside of it (data/information). You can swap out (reassign) the food inside, but the variable remains the same.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I am currently looking for apartments in Colorado and using Facebook Marketplace.
Initiate login with correct password - boolean
Location - string
Price - number


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into one string


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
In Facebook Marketplace, I believe the developers used concatention by displaying my input in a seamless string above the search results.
For example: Showing results for 1 Bedroom between $1000 and $1300 in the Lakewood, CO area

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
What is the difference in assigning a variable as a boolean data type vs any other data type with a if/else command?
