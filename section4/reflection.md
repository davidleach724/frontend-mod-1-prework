## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?


It felt better, I did take more breaks than before, but it was hard to force myself to take a break when things were really cookin.


1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?


I was surprised to see that I felt more refreshed for longer periods of time. Also my overall level of fatigue was reduced. I did hit a wall, but it was after several several hours in which I probably shouldn't have still been working, but I felt like I was on a roll.


1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?


An object is a data type that can hold a collection of multiple types of data and also can transform that data. Objects differ from arrays because objects represent a 'thing' and are made up of values or characteristics that define that 'thing'.


1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class, Array
  * List of states and their capitals, Object
  * List of things to pack for vacation, Array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow, Array
  * List of student names and their cohort, Object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake, Object
  * All my favorite restaurants, Array


1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?


I have been stressing about finding a place to live (I'm moving from Oklahoma to Colorado before Mod1 starts) and so I have been living on zillow and apartments.com and you name it. I could see a class for searching for a rental property. Some keys and their values involved could be:
-rentalType, house, apartment, etc.
-dateAvailavble, date range
-rentMin, min rent $
-rentMax, max rent $
-hasPet, true or false


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?


I have had a very very basic introduction about 10 years ago in school and I remember when we started to go over classes, I kinda checked out. I have a firmer grasp on it now, but it is still a little foreign. I ended section4 with a much stronger understanding of the concepts; I think I will just need repetition to get it down
