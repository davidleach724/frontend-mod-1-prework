## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?


I liked the article's concept of "S.M.A.R.T. Goals". I sometimes get over my head with the amount that I take on and this is a solid way of breaking down your work load into manageable chunks.

I really resonated with the interview video. There are a lot of moments in life when you're learning a new concept that seems more than completely foreign and you feel like you're never going to get it. It's really easy to give up and get inside your head, but that's really not the approach you should have. Just because you are struggling with a problem or a concept, doesn't mean that you are not an intelligent person. You need to reflect on you own progress and figure out what you need to learn to move forward.


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?


I do believe that we all have the capability to continue learning and am very open minded about growth potential. I think I could definitely be better at not comparing the speed of my personal progress with others. I do this sometimes, but I could absolutely be better. During Turing, I plan on incorporating a more positive attitude towards myself on days where things aren't going well.


3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.


Whenever you're searching for recipes and you want to pull up a specific list, lets say "4th of July foods", I see the results coming back in array form ex) ['hotdogs, 'hamburgers', 'popsicles', 'prob some sort of beer fried madness']

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.


Array methods are specific functions that can be used to effect the data in an array.


5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?


A loop is designed to execute a process a number of times until a desired process is complete


6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?


If a kid spent all Saturday collecting rocks for their rock collection, they need to wash each one (perform some sort of action) and add them to their rock collection until they have completed the process for all of the newly collected rocks.


7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?


I have a pretty sound understanding; repetition and further examples will further solidify the concepts.
