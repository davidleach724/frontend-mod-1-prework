## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?


I feel comfortable asking questions, however, if I do get stuck I am guilty of trying to
figure out my problem on my own. Since I have started Mod0, I have actively forced myself
to participate and reach out to others on Slack whenever I have a question.


2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?


I actually felt really comfortable navigating through the files and exercises! I did refer
to my notes several times and that helped reinforce new concepts.


3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.


A conditional statement is statement that can be evaluated as true or false. This morning I was determining if I had enough eggs to make my favorite breakfast, I did not so I had to go to the store. If I wanted to check out a brewery's website, chances are there would be some sort of age validation asking if I am over 21 or not.


4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.


You can add multiple conditions by following the initial `if` statement with subsequent `else if` statements. Whenever a condition returns true, the code that is grouped with it is executed. If it returns false, it jumps to the next section and determines if it meets the next condition.


5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?


To check that two conditions are met you can include a logical operator. `&&` represents 'and' and will come back true if the expressions on both sides are true, if not, it will return false. `||` represents 'or' and will come back true if either expression returns true, if both false it will return false.


6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?


So far, things are pretty solid. I think I will spend some extra time whenever we get into the oder of operations in more complex functions.
